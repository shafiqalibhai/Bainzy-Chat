supportyn.php
Written by - Gene Wells

supportyn.php is used only if you're using the Live Support feature of FlashChat to provide live tech support. It will display a small image file to indicate if you have an Admin or Moderator in the Chat. You can use your own images as long as they have the same filename.ext as the one provided: supportoffline.gif and supportonline.gif.

It works best in an iframe.

iframe code example to insert into html web page: (change url as needed)

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3">
<iframe src="chat/supportyn.php" width="80%" height="500"></iframe>
