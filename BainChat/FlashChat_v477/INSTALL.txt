INSTALLATION:

1) Upload the entire "chat" folder to your server, using binary FTP transfer.

2) Open the "install.php" file using your web browser, and follow the on-screen instructions.

For example, if you uploaded the "chat" folder to:

http://www.yourserver.com/chat/

...then you would direct your web browser to...

http://www.yourserver.com/chat/install.php

HOWEVER - If you wish to integrate FlashChat with a Bulletin Board or Content Management System, please use the "Integrating FlashChat" instructions found online at: 

http://www.tufat.com/docs/flashchat/integration.html
